How to run:

Steps to follow for inferencing model.
1. Load the model using HuggingFace's pipeline in text generation mode.
2. Specify the model name.
## Quick start

```python
from transformers import pipeline

question = "If you had a time machine, but could only go to the past or the future once and never return, which would you choose and why?"
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="navaneeth45/Qwen2.5-1.5B-thinking-reasoning-model-V0", device="cuda")
output = generator([{"role": "user", "content": question}], max_new_tokens=128, return_full_text=False)[0]
print(output["generated_text"])
```

Alternately you can directly run all the cells in inference.ipynb and change the prompts if needed.
